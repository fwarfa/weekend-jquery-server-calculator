## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

- In this project I created an app that will take input from the user and do mathmatical calculations 
based on those inputs and selected operator. It then returned and displayed those results
- My project solved the following problems:
    - Doing the math calculations
    - Displaying those results correctly on the DOM
    - Making sure all the correct endpoints were hit
    - Storing the data to display even if page refreshed
    - Rerendering all of the previous calcuations to the page
- I was able to solve these issues with repition, problem solving, collaborating with others
and lots of trial and error.
